###Problem Statement
Currently, Bao is working for UW-Health as an IS analyst. Each week, there is always one person on call in case there is an IS related emergency. The schedule rotates on a weekly basis between 7 people in the unit. Each week starts on Thursday at 7:00 a.m. The rotating schedule has already been filled out for this year except for holiday weeks. UW-Health recognizes 8 holidays every year, New Years, Martin Luther King Day, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Chirtsmas Eve, and Christmas Day. The way that the holiday schedule is currently filled out is by having the whole unit email Bao an Excel spreadsheet with the holidays ranked from 1-8. 1 being the holiday the employee would prefer to work and 8 being the holiday the employee would prefer to have off. What we would like to create is a simple program that will populate the on-call holiday weeks with the employee's input of top 2 holidays to work and the 1 holiday they would like off. This will save Bao some time from having to go through all the spreadsheets and tallying up everyone's holiday choices. Not only that, but this will create a more neutral scheduling process.
